# Window Size Tracker

A simple, lightweight web application built with **React** that tracks and displays the real-time dimensions of your browser window.

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to practice two fundamental React hooks:

* `useState`: To manage the state of the window's width and height.

* `useEffect`: To handle the side effect of adding and removing an event listener for the `resize` event, ensuring the application is performant and avoids memory leaks.

## Live Demo

You can see the application in action here:

1. Open the live demo link in your browser.

2. Resize your browser window (by dragging its edges or corners).

3. Watch as the displayed width and height values update instantly.
